# React ATM 

# Coding Challenge
It’s payday and there’s a new Pokémon game in town so Michael wants to buy a Switch 🎉 It costs £270, and we’d like you to build an ATM web app he can use. He will need to enter his PIN ( 1111 ) which you should check against the PIN API. The API will tell you his current balance, which should then be shown on screen.

He’s going to make 3 withdrawals:

● £140

● £50

● £90

Unbeknownst to Michael, diggers keep stealing our ATMs so we aren’t carrying a lot of notes. The machine has: 4 x £5 notes 15 x £10 notes 7 x £20 notes You should try to give a roughly even mix of notes when possible, and will have to take into account what to do when certain ones run out. Your ATM allows an overdraft of up to £100 and should let users know if they do go overdrawn 😬

# Approach
I wanted to create something that would work on a touchscreen ATM. So big easy to see and touch buttons and text. I also wanted it to be responsive and combine pages like balance, overdraft, returning card were possible.

# Installation / Local Server / Run Tests
```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  npm run test
```

# Tech
React, axios, vite, vitest, react-testing-libary, react-icons, bootstrap

# Limitations
With more time I would have like to have added a good bit of polish. Right now, I feel like it is a solid first draft, with more time I would have wanted to do a good ol' refactor, add more tests, responsive tweaks and few other bits and pieces.
